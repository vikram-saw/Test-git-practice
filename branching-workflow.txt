- How can you restrict deploying code changes (CF Stack Changes) to prod environment only from main branch.

- Merge command :
	merge : branch-1 to branch-2
	Local merge : git merge child_branch
	remote merge : Pull Request -> Reviwer

push : 
git push origin child_branch # local child_branch --> remote branch-1

pull:
remote branch-1 to local branch-1

# Creating a child branch from main
git checkout main
git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
	OR
git checkout -b feature1

------------------------
git push 
	master -> origin/master
	
git pull
	origin/master -> master
	
Pull Request:
	origin/master << origin/child_branch

------------
# Assuming there are 3 commits in master branch
git checkout master # (3)
git branch child_branch # this will create a new branch having 3 commits from master 
git checkout child_branch # checkout to child_branch in local
git commit # creating a commit by changing some files (4)
git commit # creating a commit by changing some files (5)

git push origin child_branch # this will push local to remote child_branch i.e child_branch -> origin/child_branch

Raise a PR : master (3) << child_branch (5)
Approved and merged : origin/master << child_branch # Here commits from origin/child_branch will be merged into origin/master branch

git checkout master # Checkout to master branch locally
git pull origin master # Since Upstream remote branch i.e origin/master branch is merged with child_branch, the local master branch needs to have those commits to i.e origin/master -> master
	
Note : If u don't take the latest pull of origin branch to local before creating a new branch, the new child branch might have older code, hence git pull should be used to sync branches from remote to local repository.
